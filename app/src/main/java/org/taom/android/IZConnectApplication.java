     * notification out to all of our obsservers which tells them to exit.
     *
     * Note that as a result of the notification, all of the observers will
     * stop -- as they should.  One of the things that will stop is the AllJoyn
     * Service.  Notice that it is started in the onCreate() method of the
     * Application.  As noted in the Android documentation, the Application
     * class never gets torn down, nor does it provide a way to tear itself
     * down.  Thus, if the Chat application is ever run again, we need to have
     * a way of detecting the case where it is "re-run" and then "re-start"
     * the service.
